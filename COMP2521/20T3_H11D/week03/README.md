# Week 3 Tut

## Content
- Today we went over Analysis of Algorithm! I've included a recap on Big-O notation + explanations for all the tut questions (in aesthetic formatting as usual)
- I also noticed a bunch of people get the last question in Circular Queue from lab02 wrong, ive made a cheat sheet to understand why!

## Homework
- Don't forget to chill out (oh yeah and also the quizzes are a thing too).

### See you next week absolute legends!
